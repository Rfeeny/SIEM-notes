Slpunk

Splunk is a big data solution. The SIEM is just a very useful part of it.

There are many applications that can be downloaded on splunk. Add-ons are smaller downloadable features. Suites are large collections of applications that can be used for specific
fields.

Boolean expressions AND OR NOT

Piping and commands like head and sort can be used


We can use the eval command to create fields.
The eval command calculates an expression (such as if then) and places the resulting values into a search field.
If the search field doesn't exist, it creates a new search field.
If the search field does exist, it overwrites the field with the new values.
Enter the following SPL query in your search bar:


source="statsreport.csv" | eval BruteForce = if('EventCode'="4740","Potential Brute Force", "Not Brute Force")
source="statsreport.csv": Searches through all the results from the statsreport.csv file
eval BruteForce: Creates a new field called BruteForce
if('EventCode'="4740": States the expression, If the event code field has a value of 4740
"Potential Brute Force": Continues the statement with, If true, name this value Potential Brute Force. This is the value to display if the expression for the event is true
"Not Brute Force": Continues the statement with, If false, name this value Not Brute Force
